This readme is a brief tutorial on how to run the project and what the codes are expected to do. In case of any question during running, please kindly contact chenqy@umich.edu and yilegu@umich.edu.

Pre-requisite:
1. Dataset: Yelp dataset, unzipped and put in the directory ./dataset. In ./dataset there should be five .json files. For example, the path to one of the .json file will be ./dataset/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json

2. Packages: Many of these are quite common packages and are likely to have been installed on users' platforms. In the case of missing a package, pip should install them fine.
	json
	numpy
	pandas
	collections
	matplotlib
	dataprocessing
	surprise
	lightfm
	sklearn
	plotly
	datapane

How to run the project:
1. "python3 filter_GA_restaurants_and_users.py" to get two files, "GA_restaurants.json" and "GA_users.json". This step filters our data of interest and limit the user and business data to a reasonable range as specified in the report.

2. "python3 GA_resturants_and_users_to_index.py" to create a mapping of users and businesses to their corresponding indices. You should have "GA_restaurants_indices.json" and "GA_users_indices.json" by then.

3. "python3 datapreprocessing.py" to create the rating matrix R. It should a file called "GA.csv".

4. "python3 baseline_model.py" to run the baseline model and get corresponding metrics like RMSE.

5. "python3 SVD_model.py" to run the SVD model and get the best set of hyperparameters and corresponding metrics like RMSE.

6. "python3 NMF_model.py" to run the NMF model and get the best set of hyperparameters and corresponding metrics like RMSE.

7. "python3 lighFM_model_FeatureBased.py" to run the feature-based lightFM model and corrsponding metrics like AUC score.

8. "python3 visualization.py" to run the visualization.

9. When needed, run "python3 prediction_recall_k.py" to get metrics like AUC score for all sorts of models.
